# Chapter 2 Probability
## What is probability?
## Examples
    1. Count the number of arrivals requests to a web server in a day
        Sample space: {0,1,2,3...} -Discrete
    2. Execution time of a program
        (0,infinity) - Continuous 

    Common feature: "outcome" is uncertain- not known beforehand
    
    ### Random phenomena in computer environments:
        * Arrival of jobs
        * Execution time
        * Memory requirement
        * Exposure to virus
        * Errors in code, etc.

## Notation
    * Sample space: Ω
        * collection of all outcomes
        * P(Ω) = 1 - Defined event, will always happen
    * Empty event: Φ 
        * eg. decimal number of jobs- set is only whole numbers
        * P(Φ) = 0 - Always 0
    * Event: event A, event B, etc.
        * collection of some outcomes- subset of sample space, Ω
        ### In ex1, Event of "having even number of jobs."
            A: {0, 2, 4, 6, ...}

        ### In ex2, Event of "exectuion time is less than 1 hour."
            B: {ε < 1 hour}

    * Set Operations
        * Union of A and B: A ∪ B
        * Intersection of A and B: A ∩ B
        * Complement of A: ~A (use overhead bar notation)
            * P(A) + P(~A) = 1
                P(A) = 1 - P(A)
        * Difference: A\B
            * Outcomes in A that are not in B
