## Slide 11- Graph of membrane potentials
* At rest K+ channels are highly permeable compared to Na+ channels which is why the resting membrane potential is closer to K+'s equilibrium potential instead of Na+'s

## Slide 14- Julius Bernstein
* If his theory of membrane breakdown was true, capacitance would radically decrease since there is no longer a dielectric.

## Slide 16- Exceptions to Ohm's Law
* V - Veq is displacement from equilibrium potential-- how far away is voltage from the equilbrium

## Slide 17- Current Voltage Plot
* As potential is becoming more negative, the more Na+ wants to go into the cell
* There was already a concentration gradient, but now theres an electromotive force.
* Negative y-axis is current moving into the cell

## Slide 19- Current and Voltage Plots
* Slope is equivalent to conductance (current != conductance)
* If they're all crossing through 0, there's no potential, meaning no battery. 
* Concentration is same outside and inside cell.

## Slide 21- Current and Voltage Plots
* Step graph is because closed ion channels suddenly opened.
* E2 is Na+, E1 is K+
* Slopes of B and D are much greater than A and C because conductance grew after voltage gated channels opened.
* Rectification is a change in conductance with a change in voltage.

## Slide 23- Current and Voltage Plots
* Slope is gradual increase in conductance.

## Slide 24- Cell Membrane Time Constant
* Use the risng or falling slope to find the time constant.
* Using total current generated and the size of each type of ion channel- can calculate number of channels open.
