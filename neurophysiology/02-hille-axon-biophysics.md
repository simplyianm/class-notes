## Slide 9- Action Potential
* Since peak of action potential was above 0, this means there is not general permeability for all ions

## Slide 13 Animation
* Injection of negative charges when voltage clamping
* Question: If you increase the concentration of K+ outside the cell what happens to the resting membrane potential? It will become more positive
* This is because increased K+ outside would decrease the rate of K+ outflow from the cell.
* If you can inject an electrode to insert - charges, you can depolarize by placing K+ around the cells for voltage clamping.
# Slide 14 Exclusive Pottasium Dependence charts
* Only K+ change outside the cell affects RMP
* If you clamp the voltage at +67 mv and open sodium channels what will happen to the membrane current? Thre will be no net ion flow.
# Slide 15
* When clamped to 0 from -65mV, the inward deflection is Na+ coming in and the outward deflection is K+ going out
