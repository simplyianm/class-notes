## Slide 9- Action Potential
* Since peak of action potential was above 0, this means there is not general permeability for all ions

## Slide 13 Animation
* Injection of negative charges when voltage clamping
* Question: If you increase the concentration of K+ outside the cell what happens to the resting membrane potential? It will become more positive
* This is because increased K+ outside would decrease the rate of K+ outflow from the cell.
* If you can inject an electrode to insert - charges, you can depolarize by placing K+ around the cells for voltage clamping.
# Slide 14 Exclusive Pottasium Dependence charts
* Only K+ change outside the cell affects RMP
* If you clamp the voltage at +67 mv and open sodium channels what will happen to the membrane current? Thre will be no net ion flow.
# Slide 15
* When clamped to 0 from -65mV, the inward deflection is Na+ coming in and the outward deflection is K+ going out

## Slide 22- H.H. Membrane Model
* Capacitive current, current kind of goes over capacitor, ion flow is effectively a current.
* gL is leak current?
## Slide 23- Conductance Changes
* Conductance for Na+ increases as voltage increase, but once you go over 44mV, even if you go higher, conductance can't increase further.
* Timing of Na+ and K+ conductance is completely different
    * Need this for action potential to work properly
## Slide 24- Voltage Dependence of IOnic Conductance
* Don't really care about slope, just notice conductance saturates as voltage gets high enough
## Slide 25- Membrane Dynamics
* If you bring the voltage down for Na+ while it's at it's peak, it rapidly comes down again since it is highly voltage sensitive. Rapid decrease after rapid increase due to stimulation is deactivation. Inactivation is gradual decrease that happens naturally even as the voltage is high.
* At deactivation point for Na+, the stimulus doesn't really affect K+ since it hasn't really started going. However, if you decrease voltage later, it deactivates. However, this doesn't really affect Na+ since Na+ finished before this (has a quick inactivation)
## Slide 29- Report
* The movement of the pore itself throught the cell membrane is a measurable current.
## Slide 31- Two-pulse Voltage Clamp
* The more positive the starting voltage is, the less the amplitude of the Na+ current, since at lower voltage, there are more Na+ channels to activate.
