## Slide 5- Calcium Channel Properties
* Everything but 4, 7, and 9 applies to K+ and Ca+

## Slide 15- Timing of synaptic events
* Delay between postsynaptic potential and Ca+ current is due to activities at synapse. Gap junction would be much faster.
* Width of action potential determines how long Ca+ channels are open. 
    * The longer you're in a depolarized range, the longer the Ca+ channels stay open.
    * Slight change in width causes a huge impact on transmitter release.
## Slide 16- Longer AP or more AP's cause greater Ca2+ influx
* Figure out how much calcium in cell by determining fluorescence level
* 5 AP's causes a huge rise in Ca+ influx- 50nM vs 200nM
## Slide 17- Comparing Ca2+ Dependence of Release Triggering with that of Vesicle Recruitment Graph
* Very steep calcium channel. 
* Vesicle recruitment doesn't really change much due to calcium.
* Nanodomain is area right around Ca2+ channel- So recruitment is higher there.
* Vesicle *recruitment* is not calcium dependent process
## Slide 18- Calcium Current and Concentration as a Function of Membrane Voltage
* Peak is where all the channels are open. 
* Ca2+ still comes in at a lower rate until equilbrium potential reached.
* Moral is even if there is a massive depolarization, Ca2+ may not necessarily rush in.
    * Sweet spot is around +20mV for max calcium influx.
## Slide 19- Calcium Current and Concentration as a Function of Membrane Voltage
* Have to have action potential for postsynaptic release.
* Sweet spot is around -20mv.
    * So again, you won't get calcium release, meaning no transmitter release, if voltage depol. too high
## Slide 21- Voltage Gated Ca++ Channel Classifications
* A) From -80 you get current, from -30 to -20, already deactivated so no change
## Slide 27- Ca++ Channel Pharmacology
* Dihydopyridines- human made?, know them
## Slide 29- Table
* **Don't memorize**
