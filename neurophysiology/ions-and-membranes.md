## Slide 4- Osmosis
    * If membrane isn't permeable to ion, water moves to compensate. 
    * Note: at one point, the pressure of water balances osmosis and movement stops.
## Slide 6- Cell Membranes
    * Phospate head is what gives resting membrane potential its negative charge NOT negative proteins
## Slide 13- Hydration of Ions
    * Ions are willing to give up hydration shell to go into pore if there are charges in the channel that stabilize the ion.
## Slide 16- Electronegativity
    * Number of protons in nucleus vs how close electrons can get to protons in nucleus
        Therefore left to right and bottom to top
## Slide 18- Hydrated Ion Size
    * Pores have options for how to be constructed, only allow hydrated or not.
        * Eg. K+ without water is larger than Ca2+, however with shell, K+ is smaller than Ca2+.
        * Different methods to chose selectivity.
        * Some channels can be very selective by having special properties pertaining to a small set of ions.
## Slide 20- Selectivity in Na+ channels
    * Reason K+ doesn't go in without water is that it is already stable with water-- channel needs to be perfect for K+ to shed water willingly
    * Reason K+ with water is still larger than Na+ with water is cuz it is partially hydrated, not fully

## Slide 24- Cell Membrane Structure    
    * Carrier is a protein that picks up ion and dumps it on other side
## Slide 29- Typical Biological Ion Concentrations
    * Na+ high on outside
    * K+ high inside- Na/K pump maintains this
    * Ca2+ higher outside?
    * Cl- is higher outside
## Slide 34- Passive Transport Mechanisms
    * Antiporter eg. 
        Let Na+ come in, use energy that is released by this movement down gradient and pump Ca+ out
